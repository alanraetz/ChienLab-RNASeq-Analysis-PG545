# ChienLab-RNASeq-Analysis-PG545

PG545 is a heparin sulfate mimetic that is an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials and was recently shown 
to have potent activity against SARS-CoV2. In this experiment, Ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with 
PG545 versus control vehicle, and analyzed for differential gene expression with RNASeq to understand what
genes and gene pathways are altered by PG545 treatment of ovarian cancer. 

Raw RNASeq reads were quantified using [Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html).

Differential gene expression (PG545-treated versus untreated conditions) was quantified using [DESeq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8).
